UseCase: Container Registry System

The title itself is self-explanatory in this use case we are creating a container system which accepts the client request to allocate a node with sufficient resources available to run the selected docker image as requested by the user. The container system up looks for a node within its cluster and selects one to install the docker image based on the usage of the resources like RAM usage, CPU process time the registry system calculates the price based on its price strategy and notifies the client.
